- Live Site URL: [here](https://michalmiotla.github.io/loopstudios-landing-page-Tailwind-/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was my second project with Tailwind. I was focused on working flow and responsiveness of site on each view, from 375px to 1440px. I've learned how to use :before and :after pseudoclasses in html code and tailwind gradient system.

### Continued development

Now it's time for my own projects, which will include, among others, Taiwlind technology.

### Useful resources

- [CSSGradient](https://cssgradient.io) - simple, but actual pretty solid site, which helps us with gradient properties.
